This library provides support for source-code annotations in PHP.

This library references practices and features established by other languages and platforms with native support
for annotations, mainly C#/.NET and Java, drawing on the strengths (while observing the limitations) of the
PHP language.

The main areas of this Wiki are listed below:

* :doc:`*Roadmap, upgrading and release notes <Roadmap>`
* :doc:`*Understanding and applying annotations to PHP source code <UsingAnnotations>`
* :doc:`*Consuming source-code annotations at run-time <ConsumingAnnotations>`
* :doc:`*Writing your own types of annotations <CustomAnnotations>`
* :doc:`*See a fully documented, step-by-step example of declarative meta-programming at work <DemoScript>`
* :doc:`*Review the standard library of annotations <AnnotationLibrary>`
* :doc:`*Learn more about the design considerations behind this library <DesignConsiderations>`

This library was created by `Rasmus Schultz <https://github.com/mindplay-dk>`_ - a lot of careful planning and design
went into this project, which was in development for almost a year before it's initial release.
